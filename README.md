KT News Central


Overview


My project, KT News Central (KTNC), is a web application designed to help users discover, save, and interact with news articles. Users can create accounts, browse articles from various sources, mark articles as favorites, and comment on them. The application leverages a React frontend for its dynamic user interface and an Express.js backend for handling user authentication, managing favorites, and serving article data. Through this project, users can personalize their news consumption experience by saving favorite articles and engaging with other users through comments. With an intuitive interface and seamless interaction, my project aims to enhance the way users engage with news content online.
